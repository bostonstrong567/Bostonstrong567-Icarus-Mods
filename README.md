# Bostonstrong567's Icarus Mods

Welcome to my repository for my Icarus mods! Mods:

1. [More DropShip Slots!](Mods/More%20Drop%20Ship%20Slots)
2. [Eye Colors Expanded!](Mods/Eye%20Colors%20Expanded!)

## Installations

### Manual Installation

If you don't have [Icarus Mod Manager](https://projectdaedalus.app/tools), I recommend you download it.

For manual installation, do the following:

1. Download only the `.pak` from [The Mods Directory](Mods).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your Icarus game directory using a tool such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org).
3. Move the `.pak` file to the `\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods` directory. If the `mods` folder doesn't exist, create one inside `\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\` called `mods`.
4. Launch the game and enjoy.

### Automatic Installation

For automatic installation, do the following:

1. Open [Icarus Mod Manager](https://projectdaedalus.app/tools).
2. Download only the `.EXMODZ` from [The Mods Directory](Mods).
3. Click `Import EXMODZ File`.
