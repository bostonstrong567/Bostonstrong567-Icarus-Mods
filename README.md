## Mod Descriptions

1. The [More DropShip Slots!](Mods/More%20Drop%20Ship%20Slots) mod increases the number of available drop ship slots to 25, allowing you to bring more resources, tools, and equipment to the mission.
2. The [Eye Colors Expanded!](Mods/Eye%20Colors%20Expanded!) mod introduces a wider range of eye colors for your character customization in Icarus.

### Manual Installation

If you don't own [Icarus Mod Manager](https://projectdaedalus.app/tools), I recommend you download it.

For manual installation, do the following:

1. Download only the `.pak` from [the selected mod](Mods).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your Icarus game directory using a tool such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org).
3. Move the `.pak` file to the `\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods` directory. If the `mods` folder doesn't exist, create one inside `\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\` called `mods`.
4. Launch the game and enjoy.
